There's 4 links included in the program, to change the site to be searched, put a '#' before the current link at the top (assigned to the url variable), and delete the '#' before a different link.

Once the program runs, there will be a text file called output.txt which has the required information.

This program examines the html files directly from the websites, so there won't be .html files in the directory.  This also means that the machine running this program must have an internet connection and the 'BeautifulSoup' Library.
